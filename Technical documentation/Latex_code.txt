\subsection{Battery, Li- ion based battery}
Battery is a device that stores electrical energy in a chemical form and converts it back into electrical energy when needed. Batteries can be used in various applications, including mobile devices, electric vehicles, energy storage systems, and more. They come in different types, including lithium-ion, lead-acid, and nickel-metal hydride.
A lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery is a type of rechargeable battery commonly used in portable electronics, electric vehicles (EVs), and renewable energy systems. Here are the key features and components of Li-ion batteries:
Li-ion batteries consist of lithium compounds, typically in the form of lithium salts, used in the electrolyte and electrodes.
The two primary electrodes are, cathode The positive electrode, commonly made from materials like lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), or nickel manganese cobalt (NMC). Anode The negative electrode, usually made from graphite or other carbon-based materials.  
Electrolyte. The electrolyte in a Li-ion battery is usually a lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent. It allows lithium ions to move between the cathode and anode during charging and discharging. Charging: When the battery is charged, lithium ions move from the cathode to the anode, where they are stored. Discharging: When the battery is used, lithium ions move back to the cathode, generating an electric current that powers devices. Li-ion batteries have a high energy density, meaning they can store a large amount of energy relative to their weight and size. This makes them ideal for portable electronics and EVs. These batteries are known for their efficiency, allowing for quick charging and a long cycle life (number of charge/discharge cycles they can undergo before performance degrades).

    \subsection{BMS, battery management system}
A Battery Management System (BMS) is a system that monitors, controls, and manages rechargeable batteries, especially in applications like electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and consumer electronics. It ensures safe and efficient battery operation by balancing cells, protecting against overcharge and over-discharge, and estimating the battery's state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH). BMS plays a critical role in enhancing battery life, safety, and performance.

\textbf{System Interactions and Working Mechanism} \\
In operation, the battery provides power that flows through the BMS, which manages and safeguards the energy output. The BMS distributes power to the joulemeter, where energy consumption is tracked and monitored. From the joulemeter, power moves to the motor driver, which controls the BLDC motor's operation based on instructions from the microcontroller. The microcontroller, receiving inputs from the Hall position sensor, can adjust the motor’s speed and direction dynamically. This feedback loop between the motor driver, microcontroller, and sensor ensures precise and responsive control over the motor. Simultaneously, the DC-DC converter steps down voltage from the battery to power lower-voltage devices, such as the horn and lighting system. These components are activated as needed, with the horn providing audible alerts and the lighting system ensuring visibility or signaling functionality. In essence, this setup enables seamless interaction between the battery and various components, allowing for precise motor control, efficient energy management, and integrated safety features. The BMS and microcontroller play central roles in coordinating these functions, ensuring both efficiency and safety across the system.
\end{flushleft}


\section*{Power conversion: How power is converted and managed between components}
\begin{flushleft}
    The power management and conversion system in this electric vehicle (EV) setup illustrates the coordinated interaction of each component to maximize efficiency and functionality. The \textbf{Battery Management System (BMS)} plays a vital role in monitoring and protecting the battery pack by balancing cell voltages and guarding against conditions such as overvoltage, undervoltage, and overcurrent. The BMS is integral to extending battery life and ensuring safety, as demonstrated in research by Nishimura et al. (2021) and Coulom et al. (2019), which discuss BMS architectures and thermal regulation in lithium-ion batteries.

The \textbf{DC/DC converter} transforms the high-voltage output from the battery to lower voltages suitable for auxiliary systems, including lights, control electronics, and other low-power components. This converter, typically employing buck, boost, or buck-boost topologies, ensures efficient power distribution across the vehicle’s systems. Studies by Ma et al. (2020) have examined the design of high-efficiency DC/DC converters specifically tailored for EV powertrains, underscoring their significance for effective energy management.

The \textbf{Joulmeter} tracks energy consumption, providing data that can inform driving strategies to enhance efficiency---a crucial aspect in energy-restricted contexts like the Shell Eco-marathon. This focus on energy monitoring aligns with findings by Peng et al. (2018), who highlight the impact of such systems on improving overall EV efficiency through optimized energy usage.

The \textbf{Motor Controller} receives signals from the \textbf{Acceleration Pedal} and \textbf{Braking Pedal} to adjust the power supplied to the \textbf{Electric Motor}, allowing precise control over speed and torque. This real-time response to driver input is essential for both performance and safety. Additionally, the \textbf{Microcontroller} processes sensor data, such as inputs from the Hall position sensor, to monitor the motor's speed and position, facilitating accurate control. Kim and Park (2022) have explored sensor-based motor control systems, which play a key role in enhancing motor efficiency and response in EV applications.

The \textbf{Electric Motor}, particularly a brushed or brushless DC motor, converts electrical energy from the battery into mechanical energy, propelling the vehicle. The mechanical power generated by the motor ($P_{\text{mech}}$) is a product of the torque ($T$) and the angular speed ($\omega$) of the motor shaft:
\begin{equation}
    P_{\text{mech}} = T \times \omega
\end{equation}

The motor’s efficiency, power density, and control complexity directly impact the vehicle's performance, as highlighted in the comparative analysis of motor types by Gupta and Singh (2019), who investigate motor selection criteria for optimizing EV systems.

The \textbf{Differential} divides the mechanical power between the left and right \textbf{Wheels}, allowing for effective torque distribution during turns and varying road conditions. This ensures stable handling and consistent power application across both wheels. The integration of a differential further enhances the vehicle's control and adaptability, particularly on uneven terrain.

The braking system communicates with the motor controller to modulate power delivery during deceleration. When the braking pedal is engaged, a signal is sent to reduce or halt power flow, thereby slowing the vehicle.

This EV power transmission system exemplifies a well-coordinated flow of electrical and mechanical energy, transforming battery power into effective propulsion. Research from Fang et al. (2021) and Tang et al. (2022) supports the integration of control signals with power components, showing that such systems are essential for optimizing energy efficiency and performance in EVs. The synergy between battery management, motor control, and differential gearing enables this vehicle to achieve smooth and efficient propulsion while maintaining control under diverse driving conditions.

\section*{Simulation on matlab}
\begin{flushleft}
The code simulates the motion of a vehicle powered by an electric motor, taking into account rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag, and motor power. Key physical and environmental parameters are defined, including the vehicle mass, tire radius, air density, and drag coefficient. The vehicle's velocity and position are calculated over time using a time-stepping method with a 0.01-second interval. The results are stored in arrays and plotted to show how the vehicle's speed and position change over a 60-second period.    
\end{flushleft}

\begin{flushleft}
    The simulation results, as shown in the plots, indicate that the vehicle's velocity gradually increases over time due to motor traction until it reaches a stable value, limited by the rolling resistance and aerodynamic drag forces. The position plot shows a near-parabolic increase, reflecting the increasing speed and the cumulative distance traveled. This demonstrates the balance between propulsion and resistive forces in electric vehicle dynamics.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Vehicle velocity over time: Shown in figure we can consider the graph and analyze it. The maximum velocity over time in 1 minute is 20 m/s, and the position 1000 m which proves that our motor works perfectly and can pull up our vehicle from starting point.

    \section*{Motor Specifications}
The given specifications of the motor are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Power: \( P = 2000 \, \text{W} \)
    \item Voltage: \( V = 48 \, \text{V} \)
    \item Speed: \( \text{RPM} = 4300 \, \text{RPM} \)
    \item Torque: We need to calculate the torque based on the power and RPM.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Step 1: Calculate the Torque}
The relationship between power, torque, and rotational speed is given by:
\[
P = \tau \cdot \omega
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P \) is the power in watts (W),
    \item \( \tau \) is the torque in newton-meters (Nm),
    \item \( \omega \) is the angular velocity in radians per second.
\end{itemize}

To find \( \omega \) from the RPM, we use the formula:
\[
\omega = \frac{\text{RPM} \cdot 2\pi}{60}
\]
Substituting the given RPM:
\[
\omega = \frac{4300 \cdot 2\pi}{60} = 450.76 \, \text{rad/s}
\]

Now, rearranging the power equation to solve for torque:
\[
\tau = \frac{P}{\omega}
\]
Substituting the given power \( P = 2000 \, \text{W} \):
\[
\tau = \frac{2000}{450.76} \approx 4.43 \, \text{Nm}
\]

\section*{Step 2: Recalculate the Traction Force}
Now that we have the torque \( \tau = 4.43 \, \text{Nm} \), we can calculate the traction force using the formula:
\[
F_{\text{traction}} = \frac{T_{\text{motor}}}{r_{\text{tire}}}
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( T_{\text{motor}} = 4.43 \, \text{Nm} \) is the torque,
    \item \( r_{\text{tire}} = 0.254 \, \text{m} \) is the radius of the tire.
\end{itemize}

Substituting the values:
\[
F_{\text{traction}} = \frac{4.43}{0.254} \approx 17.44 \, \text{N}
\]

\section*{Conclusion}
After recalculating the traction force using the correct torque value, we find that the traction force is approximately \( F_{\text{traction}} = 17.44 \, \text{N} \). This is much more realistic compared to the previously calculated traction force using the incorrect torque of 4300 Nm, which resulted in a value of 16,929.13 N.



\end{flushleft}


\begin{flushleft}
\subsection*{Rolling Resistance Force \( F_{\text{friction}} \):}

\[
F_{\text{friction}} = N_{\text{friction}} \times m_{\text{car}} \times g
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( N_{\text{friction}} \) is the rolling resistance coefficient (in our case, 0.02),
    \item \( m_{\text{car}} \) is the mass of the car (57 kg),
    \item \( g \) is the gravitational acceleration (9.81 m/s²).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Aerodynamic Drag Force \( F_{\text{air}} \):}

\[
F_{\text{air}} = 0.5 \times P_{\text{DensityOfAir}} \times C_d \times A \times v^2
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P_{\text{DensityOfAir}} \) is the air density (1.225 kg/m³),
    \item \( C_d \) is the aerodynamic drag coefficient (0.3),
    \item \( A \) is the frontal area of the car (0.5 m²),
    \item \( v \) is the car’s speed.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Step 2: Determining Traction Force}

The \textbf{traction force} \( F_{\text{traction}} \) is created by the motor and depends on the motor torque \( T \), which can be expressed through the motor’s power.

\subsection*{Motor Torque \( T \):}

\[
T = \frac{P_{\text{max}}}{\omega_{\text{max}}}
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( P_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum power of the motor (1000 W),
    \item \( \omega_{\text{max}} = \frac{V_{\text{max}}}{r_{\text{tire}}} \) is the maximum angular speed in radians per second, where \( V_{\text{max}} \) is the maximum speed and \( r_{\text{tire}} \) is the tire radius (0.254 m).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Traction Force \( F_{\text{traction}} \):}

\[
F_{\text{traction}} = \frac{T}{r_{\text{tire}}}
\]

\section*{Step 3: Calculating Force to Overcome Resistance}

For the car to move, the traction force \( F_{\text{traction}} \) must be greater than or equal to the sum of the resistance forces (rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag, and bearing friction):

\[
F_{\text{traction}} \geq F_{\text{friction}} + F_{\text{air}} + F_{\text{bearing}}
\]

If this condition is met, the motor can move the car.

\section*{Step 4: Calculating Required Power}

To ensure there is enough power to maintain movement, we can also calculate the required power to overcome all resistances at a given speed:

\[
P_{\text{required}} = (F_{\text{friction}} + F_{\text{air}}) \times v
\]

If \( P_{\text{max}} \geq P_{\text{required}} \) at the desired speed, the motor will be able to maintain the car’s movement at that speed.

\section*{Additional Mechanical Elements: Gears and Gear Ratios}

Adding gears and gear ratios affects the torque and rotational speed transferred to the wheels.

\subsection*{Gear Ratio \( G \):}

\subsubsection*{Torque After Gear Transmission \( T_{\text{gear}} \):}

\[
T_{\text{gear}} = T \times G
\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( T \) is the torque output from the motor,
    \item \( G \) is the gear ratio. For example, if \( G = 2 \), it doubles the torque but reduces the output speed.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Rotational Speed After Gear Transmission \( \omega_{\text{gear}} \):}

\[
\omega_{\text{gear}} = \frac{\omega_{\text{max}}}{G}
\]

The gear ratio decreases the rotational speed but increases the output torque.

\subsection*{Traction Force with Gear Ratio}

The traction force on the wheel \( F_{\text{traction}} \) now depends on the torque after transmission:

\[
F_{\text{traction}} = \frac{T_{\text{gear}}}{r_{\text{tire}}} = \frac{T \times G}{r_{\text{tire}}}
\]

    \item \textbf{Charging Voltage:} \( 13 \, \text{cells} \times 4.2 \, \text{V} = 54.6 \, \text{V} \).
    \item \textbf{Discharge Cut-off Voltage:} \( 13 \, \text{cells} \times 2.5 \, \text{V} = 32.5 \, \text{V} \).
    \item \textbf{Total Capacity:} \( 4 \, \text{cells in parallel} \times 4.5 \, \text{Ah per cell} = 18 \, \text{Ah} \).
    \item \textbf{Energy Capacity:} \( 48.1 \, \text{V} \times 18 \, \text{Ah} = 866 \, \text{Wh (0.866 kWh)} \).

\section*{6. Performance Analysis}

The performance of the 48V, 18.5 kWh accumulator is evaluated based on its capacity, discharge characteristics, range, and efficiency when paired with the 2000W BLDS motor. This analysis uses theoretical calculations based on battery cell and BMS specifications.

\subsection*{6.1 Capacity and Voltage Output}

The total energy capacity and voltage output of the accumulator are calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Capacity} = \text{Cell Capacity} \times \text{Number of Parallel Strings}
\]

\[
\text{Nominal Voltage} = \text{Nominal Cell Voltage} \times \text{Number of Series Cells}
\]

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
        Total Capacity & 18.5 kWh \\ \hline
        Nominal Voltage & \( 3.7 \, \text{V} \times 13 = 48.1 \, \text{V} \) \\ \hline
        Maximum Voltage & \( 4.2 \, \text{V} \times 13 = 54.6 \, \text{V} \) \\ \hline
        Minimum Voltage & \( 2.5 \, \text{V} \times 13 = 32.5 \, \text{V} \) \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Voltage Range of the Accumulator}
    \label{tab:voltage_output}
\end{table}

The usable capacity is slightly less than the total capacity due to safety margins imposed by the BMS, which cuts off the system at 32.5V to prevent cell damage. The usable capacity is approximately 17.5 kWh.

\subsection*{6.2 Discharge Characteristics}

The accumulator's discharge characteristics are determined by the motor's power requirements and the BMS's capabilities. The following formula calculates the current drawn by the motor:

\[
\text{Current} = \frac{\text{Motor Power}}{\text{Voltage}}
\]

\[
\text{Nominal Motor Current} = \frac{2000 \, \text{W}}{48 \, \text{V}} \approx 41.7 \, \text{A}
\]

The SP14S BMS supports a continuous discharge current of up to 80A, which accommodates the motor's nominal and peak loads during acceleration. Table \ref{tab:discharge} summarizes the discharge characteristics.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Value} \\ \hline
        Nominal Motor Current & 41.7A \\ \hline
        Maximum Continuous Discharge (BMS) & 80A \\ \hline
        Peak Discharge Current & 160A (short bursts) \\ \hline
        Discharge Efficiency & Over 90\% at moderate discharge rates \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Discharge Characteristics of the Accumulator}
    \label{tab:discharge}
\end{table}

\newpage
\subsection*{6.3 Estimated Range for 2000W Motor}

The range of the electric bike is estimated using the following formulas:

\[
\text{Runtime} = \frac{\text{Usable Capacity (kWh)}}{\text{Average Power Consumption (kW)}}
\]

\[
\text{Range} = \text{Runtime (hours)} \times \text{Average Speed (km/h)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[

\]

\[

\section*{6.4 Charging Time}

The charging time is calculated using the following formula:

\[
\text{Charging Time} = \frac{\text{Usable Capacity (kWh)}}{\text{Voltage (V)} \times \text{Charging Current (A)}}

\section*{8. Charging System}

The charging system is a critical component of the 48V, 18.5 kWh accumulator. It is designed to safely and efficiently recharge the battery pack while maintaining compatibility with the SP14S BMS. This system ensures proper voltage regulation, current flow, and thermal management throughout the charging process.

\subsection*{8.1 Charger Specifications}

The compatible charger is a 48V, 3.0A CC/CV charger with features optimized for lithium-ion battery packs. The charger operates in two stages: constant current (CC) mode, where it provides a steady current of 3.0A, and constant voltage (CV) mode, which maintains a voltage of 54.6V as the charging current gradually decreases. This two-stage approach ensures efficient and safe charging.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/image9.png}
    \caption{CC and CV Stages}
    \label{fig:enter-label}

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Specifications of the Compatible Charger}
    \label{tab:charger_specs}
\end{table}

\subsection*{8.2 Charging Process}

The SP14S BMS manages the charging process in three main stages. Initially, in the constant current stage, the charger supplies a fixed current of 3.0A while the BMS monitors individual cell voltages. If any cell voltage exceeds 3.4V, passive balancing is activated to equalize cell voltages. 

As the total pack voltage approaches 54.6V, the charger transitions to the constant voltage stage. In this phase, the current gradually decreases while the voltage remains steady, ensuring the cells reach full charge without exceeding 4.2V. The charging process concludes when the current drops to approximately 0.05A, at which point the BMS disconnects the circuit to prevent overcharging.

\subsection*{8.3 BMS and Charger Interaction}

The SP14S BMS ensures seamless integration with the charger by implementing multiple safety and performance measures. Overcharge protection prevents any cell from exceeding 4.2V, while passive balancing during the constant voltage stage equalizes cell voltages for optimal performance. Additionally, temperature monitoring safeguards against overheating, with charging paused if temperatures exceed 75°C. The system automatically resumes charging once temperatures return to safe levels.

    \label{fig:bms_charger_interaction}
\end{figure}




\subsection*{8.4 Fast Charging Compatibility}

The accumulator supports faster charging with compatible high-current chargers. Chargers with outputs up to 6A can be used to reduce the charging time to approximately 6 hours. However, such chargers must have a maximum output voltage of 54.6V and adhere to lithium-ion battery specifications to ensure safety and compatibility with the SP14S BMS.

\subsection*{8.5 Safety Features During Charging}

Both the charger and the SP14S BMS incorporate critical safety features to ensure reliable operation. Short-circuit protection prevents damage caused by accidental output shorts, while reverse polarity protection ensures that incorrect connections do not harm the battery or the BMS. Over-temperature protection is implemented through sensors on both the charger and BMS, which pause the charging process if overheating is detected.











\subsection*{8.6 Charging Best Practices}

To maximize the lifespan and efficiency of the accumulator, it is recommended to follow best practices during charging. Using the recommended charger ensures proper voltage and current levels. Charging should be performed regularly, avoiding deep discharges below 20\% state of charge (SOC). For extended storage, charging the battery to approximately 80\% helps prevent long-term cell degradation.

Using reference\cite{chang} and \cite{duane} we can redesign hardware system diagram to our goal. The following figure represent our hardware system. It contains DC power source, power converter. DC power source voltage is 48V battery and contain BMS to regulate it. Power converter is main part of out motor control system and must be discussed more detailed. Firstly, let's discuss type of BLDC motor, its topology and connection that we use in our vehicle. Secondly, we briefly consider main power electronics devices, like voltage regulators, transistors and they role in main circuit.

\\
\subsubsection{BLDC motor drive topology}
The main mechanical characteristics of motor drive is torque production. The effective production of torque is depend on drive topology and we consider common type of motor connection. According to \cite{duane} for high power application we full H-bridge  topology, as shown as Fig . This type of topology require 12 transistors, but we can reduce number by using two motor connection types: delta and wye.

\subsubsection{BLDC motor connection}
The typical connection of our BLDC motor is Y-type connection. It used in many cases especially in homemade purposes, reduce number of transistors. We refer the following circuit to formalize behavior and refer them in discussing motor control technique.

\subsubsection{Motor control technique}

The main electronic power component is inverter. It transforms direct current power to alternating using the control signals to regulate the voltage and the frequency of sqaure-shaped power. It's powered by DC voltage source, that in our practice is equal to 48V. The simple circuit of basic inverter is shown in Fig. 6. 

There are different switching technique to control BLDC motor. Some scholars classify them in two groups: six-steps control and vector control, also called field-oriented control. 

The main and common technique for motor control is using pulse width modulation (PWM) generator to transform logic states signals to PWM signals. This technique allow us use several features of control \cite{sang}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Linear control of the fundamental output voltage
  \item Control of frequency of the fundamental output voltage
  \item Control of harmonics included in the output voltage
\end{itemize}

More detailed explanation of motor control technique is shown in Fig 7. The scheme represent switching sequences of two-pole three-phase BLDC motor. In the BLDC motor drive, only two of the three-phase windings are excited, while the other winding is left unexcited. This made for using sensorless drive technique to determine position of rotor\cite{sang}.

\subsubsection{Rotor-Position Sensor Circuit}
In the control system of a BLDC motor with position sensors, the microprocessor controls the motor's commutation based on signals from the position sensors to maximize torque. Accurate commutation timing, derived from these sensor signals, helps reduce torque ripple, making precise position detection crucial.
Position sensors detect the rotor's position relative to the stator and provide the necessary commutation signals for the motor's logic switching circuit. These sensors convert the rotor's position into electrical signals, ensuring the stator windings switch at the right time. Common position sensors include electromagnetic, photoelectric, and magnetic types, with Hall sensors being widely used due to their simple design and low cost. The Hall sensor is used to measure speed of a rotating devices. This principle is based on Hall effect and simple implemented in most industrial motors. The simple explanation of work of Hall sensors is discussed in \cite{herman} and shown in Fig .

\subsubsection{Microprocessor Control Circuit}
According to main reference \cite{chang} A microprocessor control circuit mainly includes a microprocessor, interface circuits, and peripheral components. The microprocessor is the core of the circuit, handling input data, performing complex algorithms, sending control signals to the drive circuit, and interacting with peripherals. Choosing the right microprocessor is crucial for the system's performance.

When selecting a microprocessor for a BLDC motor control system, it's essential to consider the system's technical requirements, such as control strategy, structure, response time, and accuracy. A microprocessor that’s too powerful can add complexity and cost, while one that’s too weak may not meet the system's needs. The following factors should be considered when making the choice:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The microprocessor's instruction set should support the system's algorithms and be easy to program.
  \item The rated frequency and speed must meet the BLDC motor’s control needs.
  \item The microprocessor should have enough memory, I/O ports, and A/D and D/A channels.
  \item Power consumption, size, and operating temperature should fit the system requirements.
  \item Compatibility with both business-grade and industrial-grade versions of the microprocessor.
  \item The microprocessor's availability, reliability, and cost.
  \item The chosen microprocessor should slightly exceed system requirements to allow for future upgrades.
\end{itemize}

Microcontroller Units (MCUs) and Digital Signal Processors (DSPs) are commonly used in BLDC motor control systems.

\subsection{Protections circuit}
The protection circuit plays a crucial role in protecting components and ensuring the safety of the driver. However, on websites with open-source software, the protection circuit is not discussed in detail. The common protection circuits contain an overvoltage protection circuit, an overcurrent protection circuit and a logic protection circuit. We discuss logical protection for our vehicle, cause easy for implementation

\subsubsection{Logical protection}
If two power switches in the same leg, such as T1 and T4, conduct at the same time, it will cause a short circuit. The short current would be very high. To avoid this, many microprocessors nowadays always set a dead time for the PWM generation unit. This is a special time when the circuit is not active. When the motor starts or if the program goes wrong, the logic protection circuit shown in Figure 7.20 is usually used to protect the system. This circuit is designed to detect when two power switches in the same leg operate simultaneously. If this happens, the XOR gate will output a low-level voltage. After two AND gates, all the control signals in this leg will also become low-level voltages. This logic protection circuit effectively protects the PWM unit from short circuits. It is simple to implement.

The flowchart of the main program of a BLDC motor control system with a position sensor is shown in Fig. . For an initialization module, it contains not only the initialization of the system clock, the watchdog, the I/O port status, system interruption and other hardware systems, but also includes the initialization of the corresponding variables. During the initialization, in order to prevent accidental interrupt request, system interruption should be disabled at the start of program, which will be enabled after initialization has been performed. In addition, the general timer should be set to provide the sampling period after the initialization. Then the system will go into the cyclic-waiting state. Once the interrupt signal is received, the program will run into the timer interrupt service routine.

\end{figure}

The steering wheel used in our vehicle is designed for optimal ergonomics and functionality. Key specifications include: Type: M-shaped steering wheel. Dimensions: 19 cm (length) x 16 cm (width). Material: Lightweight ABS plastic. Integrated Controls: Hand brakes for rear brakes, CVT transmission with three speed modes.

The steering wheel includes hand brakes that directly control the rear brakes of the vehicle. This design ensures that the driver can quickly and efficiently engage the brakes without needing to move their hands away from the steering wheel, enhancing safety and response time.

The steering wheel also features controls for the vehicle's Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT), allowing the driver to switch between three speed modes. This functionality provides flexibility in adapting to different track conditions and optimizing the vehicle's performance.

The M-shaped steering wheel is centrally mounted in the vehicle's cockpit. This placement ensures that the driver can maintain a comfortable and secure grip, with all controls easily accessible. The design allows for maximum visibility of the dashboard and other instrumentation, reducing the need for the driver to look away from the road.

The steering wheel is connected to the vehicle's steering system via a steering shaft, translating the driver's inputs into precise movements of the vehicle's wheels. The integrated controls for braking and transmission are activated through buttons and levers on the steering wheel, designed for intuitive use. Regular inspections and maintenance are crucial for ensuring the steering system remains in optimal condition. This includes checking the physical integrity of the steering wheel, verifying the functionality of integrated controls, and ensuring all connections are secure and free from wear or damage.

Proper understanding and usage of the steering wheel and its integrated controls are imperative for all team members. Safety training should include user training to ensure all drivers are familiar with the layout and functions of the steering wheel, including hand brakes and transmission controls. Emergency procedures should be practiced, requiring quick maneuvering and braking to ensure drivers can respond effectively in all situations.

The M-shaped steering wheel is a vital component of our Shell Eco-marathon vehicle, providing essential control over direction, braking, and speed. Its ergonomic design and integrated features enhance both performance and safety. Regular maintenance and thorough driver training are essential to ensure the optimal performance of the steering system and the overall safety of the vehicle. \\
